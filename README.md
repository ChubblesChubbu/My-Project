## How to bootstrap an application 

The term Bootstrap means to boot or load a program using a much smaller initial program to load the selected program. 

This is often found in many operating systems such as Windows 10 or MacO. 

For Example, I want to load up Spotify from my pc, the flow will work from:

User > Machine(Laptop) > OS (Windows10) > Program.exe(Spotify).


In a case of websites, I will use my mini-portfolio as a guide on how to bootstrap an application.

## Build your application

Building your website would be the first step. Without an application, you cant bootstrap.

Because we are using REACT.JS and Node.Js, we will be using a terminal to build and bootstrap the project.

1. Open terminal on any IDE e.g.VS-CODE

2. Run these command-lines on the terminal:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
    It should look like this:

3. Open the save folder
Because we saved our app in our local user account e.g(C:\Users\user-pc), we will open the folder on the IDE

4. Your App is ready for action
While running the command line in your terminal, the package manager used was compiling every package needed to create a
single React page using (Create-React-App). It offers a build setup with no configuration needed.

Here onwards, you can build any anything your heart desires in React.JS since everything is bootstrapped for you.

The end result can look like my mini-portfolio in the link below.
